# Sum CLI

## Problem Statement

> Write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments, goes through each and prints out the sum of them. If any argument is not a whole number, skip it. Do support negative numbers though.

## Problem Steps

- Collect user arguments
- Iterate over each argument (L - loop)
  - Check if number is whole or not (C in conditionals)
    - if whole: Add two numbers together
    - else: Skip the argument
- Print out the resulting sum
